Challenges:

1. Server was not responding to ajax and datecontrol was not working
Solution:

- Cleared the server contents
- Updated pending plugins, Assemblies and Frameworks through NUGET Package
- Ran this command on the PM Console: Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.Web.Optimization
- Copied necessary contents back to the server
- Voila!!! It came up working fine

2. For relationships which are not mandatory, you should specify their int datatypes as nullable
- public Nullable<int> foreignKeyId { get; set; }

3. For us to use custom property/field in the model class, we should decorate it with this attribute
[DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Computed)]
public string AssigneeDetails{get; private set;}


4. To add migration : run this command - add-migration name_of_migration_file then run update command to update the database - update-database

5. If you are getting error: An exception of type 'System.InvalidOperationException' occurred in EntityFramework.dll but was not handled in user code.
 The model backing the 'ApplicationDbContext' context has changed since the database was created. Consider using Code First Migrations to update the database
 Solution: 
 - add-migration name_of_migration_file_not_existing
 - update-database
