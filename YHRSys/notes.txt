Challenges:

1. Server was not responding to ajax and datecontrol was not working
Solution:

- Cleared the server contents
- Updated pending plugins, Assemblies and Frameworks through NUGET Package
- Ran this command on the PM Console: Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.Web.Optimization
- Copied necessary contents back to the server
- Voila!!! It came up working fine

2. For relationships which are not mandatory, you should specify their int datatypes as nullable
- public Nullable<int> foreignKeyId { get; set; }

3. For us to use custom property/field in the model class, we should decorate it with this attribute
[DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Computed)]
public string AssigneeDetails{get; private set;}
